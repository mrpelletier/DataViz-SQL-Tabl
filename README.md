## Medicare Data Visualization

<i> For this project, I explored the Affordable Care Act, which established the HHRP (Hospital Readmission Reduction Program) to penalize hospitals with high readmission rates for certain medical conditions. I used an ETL tool, Alteryx, to pipeline Medicare data into a MySQL database (MedicareDW.sql) that I created. I cleaned and prepared the data in MySQL before connecting the database to Tableau to create a dashboard of some of the key takeaways found within the data (MedicareDB.twbx).

## Findings

<i><ul>
  <li>Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) had the highest readmission rate among HRRP conditions 22% (average being 12%)
</li>
  <li>High CHF rates were constant in Pennsylvania Hospitals</li>
  <li>Hispanic and Latino populations had the highest readmission rates for CHF at 25%
</li>
  <li>General Hospital" has had a significant uptick in readmission rates for pneumonia in the last 6 months and should be monitored.

</ul>
