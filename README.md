## Medicare Data Visualization

<i> For this project I explored the newly passed Affordable Care Act, which established the HHRP (Hospital Readmission Reduction Program) to penalize hospitals with high readmission rates for certain medical conditions. I used an ETL tool, Alteryx, to pipeline medicare data into a MySQL database (MedicareDW.sql) that I created. I cleaned and prepared the data in MySQL before connecting the database to Tableau to create a dashboard of some of my takeaways of the data (MedicareDB.twbx). </i>

## Findings

<i><ul>
  <li>Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) had highest readmission rate amoung HRRP conditions 22% (average being 12%).</li>
  <li>High CHF rates were constant in Pennsylvannia Hospitals</li>
  <li>Hisppanic and Latino populations had highest readmission rates for CHF at 25%</li>
  <li>"General Hospital" has had a significant uptick in readmission rates for pneumonia in the last 6 months and should be monitored.</li></i>
</ul>
